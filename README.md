# üìß Project: Email Customer Support Agent using LangGraph Functional APIs

## üß† Project Description

**Project-Email-CS-Agent-LangGraph-FuncAPIs** is a modular, agentic AI system designed to handle customer service tasks over email, autonomously. The project leverages **LangGraph Functional APIs** to create a reliable, intelligent, and scalable email support assistant.

This system simulates how customer service workflows can be automated using multiple agents that can communicate, reason, access tools, and respond in natural language. It is especially useful for e-commerce businesses, SaaS support, and service providers looking to reduce manual workload while maintaining high-quality customer communication.

## üéØ Objectives

* Automate the reading, classification, and response of customer support emails.
* Enable multi-agent collaboration for handling complex support scenarios.
* Integrate external tools (APIs) to retrieve order data, process refunds, and escalate issues.
* Ensure context-awareness and coherent memory-driven conversation using OpenAI agents.
* Explore LangGraph for structured, graph-based agent orchestration.

## üß© Core Components

### 1. **Multi-Agent Framework**

This project utilizes **CrewAI** and **LangGraph** to simulate a team of agents. Each agent has a specific role‚Äîparsing, classifying, resolving, or responding to customer issues‚Äîensuring tasks are handled efficiently and logically.

### 2. **LangGraph for Agent Workflow**

LangGraph allows defining structured workflows where each step represents an agent or decision node. This makes the flow of tasks transparent, modular, and easy to debug.

### 3. **Function APIs Integration**

Function APIs act as bridges between the agents and real-world services (e.g., order databases, refund systems). This extends the agent's capabilities beyond language into action.

### 4. **Email Understanding and Generation**

At its core, the system uses OpenAI‚Äôs language models to read and understand email content, determine intent, retrieve necessary information, and compose human-like responses.

## üß± Design Philosophy

* **Modularity:** Each agent or function is replaceable, allowing easy upgrades or adjustments.
* **Transparency:** Graph-based orchestration ensures the flow is understandable.
* **Autonomy:** Once deployed, the system requires minimal human intervention.
* **Scalability:** Capable of handling hundreds of emails concurrently with minor infrastructure adjustments.
